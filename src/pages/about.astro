      <p>
        I am Rick Byers, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-byers/">software engineer</a> during the day, and a molecular biology hobbyist on nights and weekends. I live in Waterloo, Canada.
      </p>

        I am fascinated (and frustrated) by the impact viruses have on our lives while remaining almost completely invisible to us. In the future it will be commonplace to closely observe microbes and the response of our immune systems, and this will revolutionize our approach to individual healthcare and public health. Through my home molecular biology lab, I am trying to get a glimpse of what living in that future will feel like. Through this blog and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lab.rbyers.ca">on BlueSky</a>, I aim to share and discuss what I learn with others who are similarly fascinated by it. You can read more about my motivation and lab setup in the speaker notes of a presentation I gave back in 2023: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uhO8CA9pNfAq7WvMBR0J71SphSPthJA-aVu92UpfuKg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p">Challenges of Personal Biotechnology</a>.
