<BaseLayout title="About the Lab">
  <p>
    I am RByers. This is my digital garden and laboratory notebook. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Here I document my findings in molecular biology, specifically focusing on the common cold virus and its myriad variations. 
    The "Lab" is both a physical space in my basement and this virtual archive.
