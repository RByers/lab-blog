Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have allowed us to visualize the adenovirus capsid at near-atomic resolution. In our basement lab, while we don't have a Titan Krios, we have managed to replicate some interesting staining patterns that suggest a divergent lattice structure in the local wild types.

## The Lattice

Standard reasoning suggests a hexon-dominant structure. However, our observations of the *Rhinovirus C* isolate indicate...
