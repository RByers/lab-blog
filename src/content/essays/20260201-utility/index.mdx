Over the past 6 years I have spent around $45k,000 USD and around a thousand hours doing over 300 experiments on the viruses moving through my household. When people ask me why on earth I would spend so much time and money on a home lab, I usually just answer "for fun" or "because I'm curious". But after nearly 6 years of running PCR assays whenever someone in the house has a cold, I can finally say that it is *sometimes* actually useful (while remaining wildly impractical of course).

I am confident that in the future home molecular testing for common pathogens will be as simple, cheap, and uncontroversial as home blood sugar testing is today, revolutionizing our approach to public health and personal medicine. In this essay I will give some background on home virus testing and share a few examples of how having a molecular virology lab in my home has benefited my family.

## Background

### The state of virus testing at home

In 2020 I [predicted](../20200418-dawn-of-personal-biotech/) that molecular virus testing would become common in the home. Of course, what I failed to predict was that rapid antigen lateral flow tests would largely fill this role for COVID-19. Antigen tests are cheap, fast and easy to use. While not technically nearly as sensitive as molecular tests, for most people looking to reduce transmission risk, antigen tests are the practical way to go. There are now also [combination antigent tests](posts/2024/20240129t222514) on the market which allow you to test for COVID-19 as well as a few other common respiratory viruses like Influenza A & B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Adenovirus.

But molecular tests have a few big advantages over antigen tests. First, they are sensitive enough to detect an infection around a day before really becoing contagious. I probably [avoided infecting a number of friends with COVID-19](/posts/2024/20240203t220244) thanks to the sensitivity of home molecular testing. Antigen tests also tend to have a small (~0.2%) risk of false positives, which can be annoying once you've done hundreds like me. Additionally molecular tests can provide a wealth of additional information, which I will go into below. 

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, two main home molecular tests were widely available (at least in North America), the [Lucira Check-It](/posts/2021/20210826t221004) and later the [Cue test](/posts/2022/20220228t001521), running around $55 - $75 USD per test. Unfortunately after a fast rise and IPO, both companies [struggled](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12461465/) (unfairly, in my opinion) with [regulatory](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/update-do-not-use-cue-healths-covid-19-tests-due-risk-false-results-fda-safety-communication) approvals and ultimately went bankrupt.

Since then the Chinese [Pluslife](https://www.pluslife.com/) [device](/posts/2024/20240803t180525) (with it's awesome 3rd party web app [virus.sucks](https://virus.sucks)) has emerged as the favourite of the COVID-concious community, with a substantial online community of fans. At around $8/test these are the most cost-effective molecular tests available to consumers. Unfortunately they are not approved in North America and have gotten more difficult to import here. [Metrix](https://shop.aptitudemedical.com/products/metrix-covid-19-test) is a new $25/test molecular testing system on the market in the US, but it's the only one I haven't yet used myself.

Consumer antigen and molecular tests are very practical and generally useful for determining infection status for viruses like COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV. Personally I run a Pluslife test whenever I want a quick test for these viruses. But their biggest limitation is that they don't test for the most common cause of the common cold, Rhinovirus. Rhinovirus is incredibly diverse and so particularly difficult to design a simple reliable test for. In my experience it's much more powerful and satisfying to reliably be able to answer the question "what do I have" instead of simply confirming "it's not COVID or Flu".

### Advantages offered by a full lab

### My goals for my lab

My primary goal with my lab is to understand how virus testing can contribute to reduced infections within my family while preserving a normal lifestyle such as eating out, travelling, and socializing. I appreciate why heavy reliance on respirator masks is a good solution for many infection-conscious individuals, but after living that lifestyle for a couple years (and despite appreciating the clear reduction in respiratory infections), my family has decided it's not a tradeoff we are willing to make ourselves. We rely on masks (and nasal sprays) primarily in high-risk environments such as airplanes and when near someone obviously sick.

## Benefits and risks for my family in practice

### Risk of false sense of confidence. 

Acknowledge research use only, not "healthcare"

### Evaluating our infection mitigation strategies

### Supporting healthcare

### Making quantified risk-benefit tradeoffs

## Looking forward

If you're still reading then I hope that means that, like me, you are intrigued by the idea of improving tools for understanding infections in our bodies. For now the best most people can do is to buy antigen tests for COVID, Flu and RSV. If you are lucky enough to have enough disposable income and live in a place where they are legally available, you could even buy a [Pluslife](https://www.pluslife.com/) or [Metrix](https://shop.aptitudemedical.com/) molecular test kit. Hopefully if enough people find these products useful, prices will come down further and more products will come to market which target more common pathogens like Rhinovirus.

In the meantime, if you want to start learning molecular biology in your own home and can spare $1,000, I suggest buying a [miniPCR](https://www.minipcr.com/product/minipcr-mini8x-thermal-cycler/) and trying out one of their [learning labs](https://www.minipcr.com/product/covid-qpcr/). Alternatively you can follow [me on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/lab.rbyers.ca) and I'll try to keep you updated without how personal virology evolves.
