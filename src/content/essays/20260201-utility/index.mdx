Over the past 6 years I have spent over $45,000 USD and around a thousand hours doing over 300 experiments on the viruses moving through my household. When people ask me why on earth I would spend so much time and money on a home lab, I usually just answer "for fun" or "because I'm curious". But after nearly 6 years of running PCR assays whenever someone in the house has a cold, I can finally say that it is *sometimes* actually useful (while remaining wildly impractical of course).

I am confident that in the future home molecular testing for common pathogens will be as simple, cheap, and uncontroversial as home blood sugar testing is today, revolutionizing our approach to public health and personal medicine. In this essay I will give some background on home virus testing and share a few examples of how having a molecular virology lab in my home has benefited my family. I am by no means arguing that my ridiculous hobby is practical or to be emulated. But I hope that I will inspire you. Who knows, maybe one of you may end up helping to bring this future to pass just a little bit faster.

## Background

### The state of virus testing at home

In 2020 I [predicted](../20200418-dawn-of-personal-biotech/) that molecular virus testing would become common in the home. Of course, what I failed to predict was that rapid antigen lateral flow tests would largely fill this role for COVID-19. Antigen tests are more practical and accessible than molecular tests, while generally performing well enough to reliably discriminate contagious individuals from those not currently contagious.

### Advantages offered by a full lab

### My goals for my lab

My primary goal with my lab is to understand how virus testing can contribute to reduced infections within my family while preserving a normal lifestyle such as eating out, travelling, and socializing. I appreciate why heavy reliance on respirator masks is a good solution for many infection-conscious individuals, but after living that lifestyle for a couple years (and despite appreciating the clear reduction in respiratory infections), my family has decided it's not a tradeoff we are willing to make ourselves. We rely on masks (and nasal sprays) primarily in high-risk environments such as airplanes and when near someone obviously sick.

## Benefits and risks for my family in practice

### Risk of false sense of confidence. 

Acknowledge research use only, not "healthcare"

### Evaluating our infection mitigation strategies

Did I catch my Son's cold?

### Supporting healthcare

PIV-2 anosmia

### Making quantified risk-benefit tradeoffs

When to isolate in the family

When to return to work - Rhinovirus

### Tailoring tradeoffs to the virus type

## Looking forward

If you're still reading then I hope that means that, like me, you are intrigued by the idea of improving tools for understanding infections in our bodies. For now the best most people can do is to buy antigen tests for COVID, Flu and RSV. If you are lucky enough to have enough disposable income and live in a place where they are legally available, you could even buy a [Pluslife](https://www.pluslife.com/) or [Metrix](https://shop.aptitudemedical.com/) molecular test kit. Hopefully if enough people find these products useful, prices will come down further and more products will come to market which target more common pathogens like Rhinovirus.

In the meantime, if you want to start learning molecular biology in your own home and can spare $1,000, I suggest buying a [miniPCR](https://www.minipcr.com/product/minipcr-mini8x-thermal-cycler/) and trying out one of their [learning labs](https://www.minipcr.com/product/covid-qpcr/). Alternatively you can follow [me on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/lab.rbyers.ca) and I'll try to keep you updated without how personal virology evolves.
