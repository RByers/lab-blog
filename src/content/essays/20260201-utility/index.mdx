Over the past 6 years I have spent around $45,000 USD in order to do 300+ experiments on the viruses moving through my household. When people ask me why on earth I would spend so much time and money on a home lab, I usually just answer "for fun" or "because I'm curious". But after nearly 6 years of running PCR assays whenever someone in the house has a cold, I can finally say that it is *sometimes* actually useful (while remaining wildly impractical of course).

I am confident that in the future home molecular testing for common pathogens will be as simple, cheap, and uncontroversial as home blood sugar testing is today, revolutionizing our approach to public health and personal medicine. In this essay I will give some background on home virus testing and share a few examples of how having a molecular virology lab in my home has benefited my family.

## Background

### Historical context

In learning about the [history of public health](https://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/), I'm struck by the repeated stories of people accepting unnecessary suffering and harm largely due to self-inflicted ignorance long past the point of scientific discovery:

- [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_(physician)) fighting to get the Broad St. pump handle removed to stop people from drinking water contaminated by cholera-ridden sewage when the prevailing belief was that disease was spread by "bad air". 
- Women dying because [doctors refused to wash their hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis) between autopsies and delivering babies.
- The nearly [century-long refusal](https://carlzimmer.com/books/airborne/) to fully appreciate that respiratory viruses are spread predominantly through inhalation of aerosols rather than through contact and droplets.

It seems that in public health, there is a huge gulf between knowledge and understanding. 20 years from now, which of our ignorances around respiratory infections will we look back on and shake our heads at? Are we now at the beginning of a new movement which will revolutionize our approach to respiratory disease the way the [sanitary movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_movement) did for waterborne pathogens?

### The state of home virus testing

In 2020 I [predicted](../20200418-dawn-of-personal-biotech/) that molecular virus testing would become common in the home. Of course, what I failed to predict was that rapid antigen lateral flow tests would largely fill this role for COVID-19. Antigen tests are cheap, fast and easy to use. While not technically nearly as sensitive as molecular tests, for most people looking to reduce transmission risk, antigen tests are the practical way to go. There are now also [combination antigent tests](posts/2024/20240129t222514) on the market which allow you to test for COVID-19 as well as a few other common respiratory viruses like Influenza A & B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Adenovirus.

But molecular tests have a few big advantages over antigen tests. First, they are sensitive enough to detect an infection around a day before really becoing contagious. I probably [avoided infecting a number of friends with COVID-19](/posts/2024/20240203t220244) thanks to the sensitivity of home molecular testing. Antigen tests also tend to have a small (~0.2%) risk of false positives, which can be annoying once you've done hundreds like me. Additionally molecular tests can provide a wealth of additional information, which I will go into below. 

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, two main home molecular tests were widely available (at least in North America), the [Lucira Check-It](/posts/2021/20210826t221004) and later the [Cue test](/posts/2022/20220228t001521), running around $55 - $75 USD per test. Unfortunately after a fast rise and IPO, both companies [struggled](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12461465/) (unfairly, in my opinion) with [regulatory](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/update-do-not-use-cue-healths-covid-19-tests-due-risk-false-results-fda-safety-communication) approvals and ultimately went bankrupt.

Since then the Chinese [Pluslife](https://www.pluslife.com/) [device](/posts/2024/20240803t180525) (with it's awesome 3rd party web app [virus.sucks](https://virus.sucks)) has emerged as the favourite of the COVID-concious community, with a substantial online community of fans. At around $8/test these are the most cost-effective molecular tests available to consumers. Unfortunately they are not approved in North America and have gotten more difficult to import here. [Metrix](https://shop.aptitudemedical.com/products/metrix-covid-19-test) is a new $25/test molecular testing system on the market in the US, but it's the only one I haven't yet used myself.

### Advantages offered by a full lab

Consumer antigen and molecular tests are practical and generally useful for determining infection status for viruses like COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV. Personally I run a Pluslife test whenever I want a quick test for these viruses. But their biggest limitation is that they don't test for the most common cause of the common cold, Rhinovirus. Rhinovirus is incredibly diverse and so particularly difficult to design a simple reliable test for. When someone is sick in my house I typically check it against 15 different viruses. In my experience it's much more powerful and satisfying to reliably be able to answer the question "what do I have" instead of simply confirming "it's not COVID or Flu". 

A molecular virology lab can also provide additional details, such as:
 - Viral load: how much virus is present
 - Variant analysis: are two samples definitely different
 - Genotyping: which exact strain of a virus is present

But how would any of that be useful?

## Anecdotes in my household

My primary goal with my lab is to deeply understand how virus testing may contribute to reduced infections. 

### Risk of false sense of confidence. 

Acknowledge research use only, not "healthcare"

### Evaluating our infection mitigation strategies

Did I catch my Son's cold?

### Supporting healthcare

### Making quantified risk-benefit tradeoffs

## Looking forward

If you're still reading then I hope that means that, like me, you are fascinated by the idea of improving tools for understanding infections in our bodies. For now the best most people can do is to buy antigen tests for COVID, Flu and RSV. If you are lucky enough to have enough disposable income and live in a place where they are legally available, you could even buy a [Pluslife](https://www.pluslife.com/) or [Metrix](https://shop.aptitudemedical.com/) molecular test kit. Hopefully if enough people find these products useful, prices will come down further and more products will come to market which target more common pathogens like Rhinovirus. Perhaps it won't be long before our toothbrushes come with cheap DNA sequencing for our whole mouth microbiome.

In the meantime, if you want to start learning molecular biology in your own home and can spare $1,000, I suggest buying a [miniPCR](https://www.minipcr.com/product/minipcr-mini8x-thermal-cycler/) and trying out one of their [learning labs](https://www.minipcr.com/product/covid-qpcr/). You can also just follow [me on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/lab.rbyers.ca) and I'll try to keep you updated on how personal virology is getting closer to reality.
