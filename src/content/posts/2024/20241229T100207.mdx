I imagine a device like PlusLife that has hundreds of tiny channels instead of just 7. Every common pathogen, many replicates and multiple targets for more reliability. A cheap and quick answer to "what do I have". Doesn't need to be perfect to be transformative!

ddPCR is widely used to run independent PCR reactions in thousands of tiny droplets. Is there some reason this principle can't be done cheaply with microfluidics and a cheap camera sensor? Can reagents be lyophilized and deposited in tiny volumes?
