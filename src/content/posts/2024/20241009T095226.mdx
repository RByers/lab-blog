What are the chances that in 20 years we all use nasal sprays to prevent respiratory infection they way we (sometimes) use sunblock to prevent sunburn?

I'm attending a conference this week and decided to use Vicks Early Defense 2-3 times daily. See eg.

Of course if I was really concerned, I'd wear a good respirator too, which I do on planes and other high-CO2 environments. So I'm definitely not arguing for a reduction in masking. But if I'm not going to mask in a moderate-risk setting anyway, spray seems worth doing to me.
