Hey @DanteLabs, are you still doing business? I've had two samples stuck in "sequencing started" for half a YEAR and no response from repeated inquiries to your support email!

Too bad, I got two good genomes from them several years ago. <a href="https://sequencing.com/blog/post/dante-labs-whole-genome-sequencing-worth-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sequencing.com/blog/post/dante-labs-whole-genome-sequencing-worth-it</a>
