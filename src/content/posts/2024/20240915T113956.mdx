I had Rhinovirus-C11 in August last year, and then my daughter caught the same variant in November. But look, there's one base (of the 390 I sequenced) different! A "G" became an "A. This is viral mutation in action, seen in my own family!

What's the chances I gave it to her, eg. by the virus surviving in our house somewhere for months? I think it's much more likely it's spread around our community.  
  
I guess I'll have to do a full genome sequence of both samples to confirm there are more mutations.
