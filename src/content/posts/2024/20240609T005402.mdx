With @CueHealth following Lucira health into bankruptcy and @DetectTest  no longer selling their COVID tests, it seems there are no consumer molecular COVID tests left on the market. Too bad. RATs are great, but molecular is better if you can afford it! <a href="https://x.com/RickByersLab/status/1799664123720130585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/RickByersLab/status/1799664123720130585</a>

I just discovered Pluslife! $8 USD/test for a NAT is amazing! I've ordered COVID and Influenza/RSV tests and will report back here after testing them. <a href="https://virus.sucks/pluslife_en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://virus.sucks/pluslife_en/</a>
