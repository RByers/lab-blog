I recently had a bad cold that lingered for a month, and I lost my sense of smell (coming back slowly now). It was a virus I hadn't seen in my lab before - Parainfluenza 3, and sure enough it's implicated in loss of smell! <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1097/MLG.0b013e318063e878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1097/MLG.0b013e318063e878</a>

What a perfect PCR amplification plot for this one 😀. One positive sample from me, one from my son, and a negative from my wife and negative control.
