We were hosting a party tonight, 18 people for dinner and fun. This morning I felt a little scratch in my throat but otherwise felt fine. 11am: negative Panbio, probably nothing to worry about. Panbio is a great test - reliably indicates contagiousness. But...

At 9pm (prime party time) I did another one, and it was positive! Now I'm contagious! Did I infect my friends? Did I have to scramble to send everyone home with the hassle and worry of being exposed? [2/4]

No! Because before I even did the Panbio, I did a @CueHealth molecular test, and it was positive 22 hours ahead of the Panbio. We postponed the party and I wore a mask around my family well before becoming contagious.
Molecular tests predict future contagiousness! [3/4]

Few people have this luxury today. Cue tests are $77 each and I'm lucky to have an employer (Google) who provides them free-of-charge. But it's just a matter of time and economies of scale before we all have multiplex molecular tests at our fingertips for a few bucks! [4/4]

Update: now a lot more people can have this luxury at only ~$8/test! Pluslife is likely at least as good as Cue, possibly even more sensitive. <a href="https://x.com/RickByersLab/status/1819857130406793719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/RickByersLab/status/1819857130406793719</a>
