I've just had the first cold go through my house since I built my home microbiology lab. qPCR test results are in and it's definitely Rhinovirus (green line at cycle 25, earlier green line is external control "B2M"). This is a big day for my long-time dream of home virus testing!

I'm sure most of you are thinking "who cares, it's not COVID so it's a cold - what difference does it make if it's Rhinovirus or Parainfluenzavirus or whatever?". That's true, I'm just geeking out on something totally impractical (as the first computer hobbyists did).

For the handful of you who want to geek out along with me, here are the assay details I used: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Unzecg72gMkiTvilp634tVyCdSa6qWtwTcD0QKhtI0g/edit#gid=1750282749" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Unzecg72gMkiTvilp634tVyCdSa6qWtwTcD0QKhtI0g/edit#gid=1750282749</a>
