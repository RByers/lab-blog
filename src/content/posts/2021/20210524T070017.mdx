It always seemed like quite a coincidence that SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in a city with one of the world's most active coronavirus research labs. Can it really be an even bigger coincidence that staff were hospitalized in Nov 2019? <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/wuhan-lab-staff-sought-hospital-care-before-covid-19-outbreak-disclosed-wsj-2021-05-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/wuhan-lab-staff-sought-hospital-care-before-covid-19-outbreak-disclosed-wsj-2021-05-23/</a>

I'm no conspiracy theorist, just a follower of Occam's razor.

Imagine, this whole pandemic may be due to one lab tech or field researcher getting sloppy in their use of PPE and accidentally exposing themself to a bat virus!
