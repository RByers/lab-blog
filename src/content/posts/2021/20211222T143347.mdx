Wow, look at the massive increase in COVID alert keys being generated for Ontario! I've plotted both the absolute value (&gt;300 keys/day) and relative to the number of 7-day cases (&gt;10%).  
Keep using the COVID alert app. With contact tracing failing it may be your only notice!

Of course COVID alert is only as good as our testing system and that's failing too.  
I know a high school student who was just contacted by public health to say they were exposed 7 days ago, and that they needed to isolate for the remaining 3 days!
