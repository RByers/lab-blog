Hey 🇨🇦Canada🇨🇦, we could effectively end this pandemic now by:  
➡️ Making rapid tests available to everyone for free (~$1B/month)  
➡️ Requiring a rapid test within 48 hours to enter any building outside your home  
  
Is the alternative of a 4th wave really the choice you prefer?

Some experts have been saying this for a year: <a href="https://time.com/5912705/covid-19-stop-spread-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://time.com/5912705/covid-19-stop-spread-christmas/</a>. The evidence and understanding keeps getting slowly stronger. Where is the tipping point?  
  
This isn't "expensive", it's the bargain of a lifetime compared to the alternative!

And since this apparently still needs to be said explicitly: of course we also need everyone to be vaccinated! But no, sadly, it doesn't look anymore like that will end the pandemic on its own, at least not without boosters for all. 😥 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html</a>
