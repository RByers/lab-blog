Canada's 8+ week COVID vaccine dosing interval has resulted in DOUBLE the protection from infection at 4-5 months post vaccination. This is a big deal, real foresight! Those with short interval (often HCWs, elderly) should get boosters sooner.

I realized I was sloppy with my wording here. So correction: "... Resulted in cutting infection risk IN HALF". VE 80%-&gt;90% means infection risk 20%-&gt;10%. "Doubling protection" isn't mathematically accurate. I'm happy to admit when I'm wrong (even without being called out). 😁
