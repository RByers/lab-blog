A few things of note from today's announcement: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j57qp1Ni3DM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j57qp1Ni3DM</a>  
Kudos to Dr. Moore for changing his strongly held opinion based on new data around Delta (or at least "newish" from the past few months)

The mention of "at home" testing is absolutely key. This isn't about healthcare workers / teachers having new responsibilities in classrooms or about take-home swabs that have to be sent to labs, it's about distributing tools to parents. That's key for real scale and impact.👍 2/

Empowering local medical officers is also great news IMHO. It means we'll see some diversity of approach that will enable us to learn and build consensus rather than everyone following the same dictated opinion. Tradeoffs are hard. Experimentation is key. 3/

Lots of emphasis on the true solution being vaccination. This confirms signals I'd been getting elsewhere - that some hesitation to embracing testing was due to the crowd looking for an alternative to vaccination. Lets all be clear: tests aren't an alternative to vaccination. 4/

Lots of emphasis on being "targeted". This makes sense when there is supply constraints, which is certainly the case. I am optimistic that strictness of targeting will diminish as comfort grows and supply increases. But this is probably the greatest risk to maximizing impact. 5/

All in all, I think there's a lot more to do to get rapid tests used at the level that's likely the sweet spot of Canada-wide cost/benefit tradeoff. But this seems likely to become a very good step in the right direction for Ontario. 6/6
