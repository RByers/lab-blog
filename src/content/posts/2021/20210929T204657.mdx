I'm luck to have had the resources to buy rapid tests for my family since the start of this pandemic (first at-home PCR, then antigen). I have been working to increase equity by helping to lead community programs. Today Dr. Moore shut that down. But I can still donate to this! <a href="https://x.com/C19TestFinders/status/1443373826369261568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/C19TestFinders/status/1443373826369261568</a>
