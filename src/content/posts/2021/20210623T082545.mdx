“It’s like you’re in the wrong job there, buddy” 😂 Right on.  
  
If your job is to help guide us with our health and you aren't willing to be vaccinated, then you aren't qualified to guide us (rare medical exemptions aside). It's not "forced", it's having the skills for the job. <a href="https://x.com/DanielGriffinMD/status/1407652109911302147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/DanielGriffinMD/status/1407652109911302147</a>
