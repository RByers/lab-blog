It's great to see Chambers of Commerce distributing rapid testing kits to families instead of just businesses! Will we wait for ICU overload to do this elsewhere in central and western Canada? @OntarioCofC @CdnChamberofCom @My_Chamber <a href="https://x.com/C19TestFinders/status/1451562679848550412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/C19TestFinders/status/1451562679848550412</a>

Of course I know all to well that this isn't up to the chambers to decide. We should all be lobbying our provincial government to expand the distribution channel we know has worked for small businesses. Its simple, pragmatic and easily actionable.
