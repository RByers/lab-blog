This study tells us what to expect from COVID in Canada this winter: lots of infections but relatively low hospitalization rate. But 10% of a big number is still a big number 😥. Hopefully longer dosing interval, boosters and rapid tests will save us from a terrible winter. <a href="https://x.com/VincentRK/status/1445164155712032770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/VincentRK/status/1445164155712032770</a>
