The @COVIDSciOntario brief on rapid antigen screening is out: <a href="https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/rapid-antigen-tests-for-voluntary-screen-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/rapid-antigen-tests-for-voluntary-screen-testing/</a>  
  
Overall I'm quite pleased with this, and it's great to have very specific recommendations for usage based on case load. 1/

However, they explicitly use a conservative specificity of 99.1%. StaySafe's experience with Panbio was consistent with the licensed specificity of 99.8%. I suspect using that number would result in guidance with a much lower threshold (perhaps 75 cases per M instead of 250). 2/

That's to say: If we use a realistic instead of conservative specificity estimate, then the advice would likely be that most Ontarians should be screening with rapid tests 2 - 3 times per week at today's case loads!
