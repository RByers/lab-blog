I've updated <a href="http://StaySafeScreen.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://StaySafeScreen.ca</a> with a list of all the HC-approved COVID antigen tests I can find available for sale in Ontario with a link to the shop with the lowest price. Let me know if I've missed any!  
Of course everybody is out of stock until January at this point 😢.
