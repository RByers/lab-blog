Millions of rapid tests have been given to businesses to help keep their workers safe. For this omicron Christmas, governments should allow those workplaces to distribute any tests they have sitting around to employees to use with their friends and families. #FreeTheRATs

Public health leaders, don't you DARE ask us to suffer in isolation and educate our kids at home again this winter unless you're going to show us some basic respect by empowering us with the education and tools needed to gather safely in small groups. #FreeTheRATs
