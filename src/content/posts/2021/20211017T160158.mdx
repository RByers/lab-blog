I'm thrilled to see this paper finally published: <a href="https://dovepress.com/recalibrating-sars-cov-2-antigen-rapid-lateral-flow-test-relative-sens-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CLEP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dovepress.com/recalibrating-sars-cov-2-antigen-rapid-lateral-flow-test-relative-sens-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CLEP</a>.  
@michaelmina_lab has been alluding to it in talks for months. It describes how even a perfect asymptomatic contagiousness test would only achieve ~50% PPA relative to PCR. 1/3

Direct comparison to PCR, which is well-known for being positive for weeks or months post contagiousness, has led to a dramatic under-appreciation of the effectiveness of antigen tests for reducing transmission risk. 2/3

Also, is it weird that this paper was accepted in May but only published now, 10 days after Biden announced the new US rapid testing plan and, on the same day, the FDA updated their guidelines potentially addressing the flaw in their approval process? <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/137907/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.fda.gov/media/137907/download</a> 3/3
