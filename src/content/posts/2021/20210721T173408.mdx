The OST report on schools expresses concerns over equity of access to rapid COVID tests (<a href="https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/school-operation-for-the-2021-2022-academic-year-in-the-context-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=There%20are%20substantial%20logistical%20and%20equity%20concerns%20that%20need%20to%20be%20taken%20into%20consideration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/school-operation-for-the-2021-2022-academic-year-in-the-context-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=There%20are%20substantial%20logistical%20and%20equity%20concerns%20that%20need%20to%20be%20taken%20into%20consideration</a>).

The situation today is that pro sports players, many politicians, employees of Canada's biggest companies (Air Canada, Rogers, etc.) and rich white dudes with the educational privilege like me are all keep our families safe by regular rapid testing.

With our #StaySafeAmbassador program (<a href="https://staysafescreen.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://staysafescreen.ca</a>) we're giving free access to anyone willing to help spread the word in the Waterloo region. But that's not nearly enough.

My daughter's private school makes regular use of rapid COVID tests. I took her out of public school due to very poor COVID protocols.  
  
How on earth can keeping these tests out of public schools possibly be an equity "improvement"?
