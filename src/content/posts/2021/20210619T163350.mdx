Hey @ResortsOntario, my family is having a great regenerative time at one of your member resorts this weekend. As someone with an unvaccinated child and concerned with COVID protocols, I feel quite safe. Thank you for your support of a safe reopening of the industry!

That said, I've seen unmasked staff talking closely with guests outdoors, and lots of staff mingling closely without masks indoors. With delta having an R0 of 5-8 and full vaccination being a couple months out for many young employees, some staff outbreaks seem sadly inevitable.

If you'd have any interest in helping your members leverage free rapid tests to reduce this risk with a minimum of hassle and cost, I'd be happy to advise. I'm a volunteer strategic advisor for COVID testing at Communitech, working with Health Canada.
