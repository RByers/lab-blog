I'm grateful for the tests that have been distributed. But 50M over ~6 months is one test per person every 2 months! Think bigger! ⬆️⬆️

I've kept my family of 4 safe by purchasing and using over 200 rapid tests in that time. So let's aim for at least 20x the volume, shall we? <a href="https://x.com/fordnation/status/1473436983297032201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/fordnation/status/1473436983297032201</a>
