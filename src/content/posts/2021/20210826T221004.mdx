15 months ago I predicted the cost for PCR machines would fall quickly from the $13,000 I spent on mine to affordable for home use. But I totally failed to predict we'd have single-use disposable molecular tests in little more than a year! <a href="https://x.com/RickByersLab/status/1393219385469325313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/RickByersLab/status/1393219385469325313</a>

This is a Check-It (<a href="https://www.lucirahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.lucirahealth.com/</a>) RT-LAMP device. Looks like 8 wells (only 6 illuminated), 2 positive controls and a CCD sensor for taking a photo of the colorimetric reaction. Seems so wasteful to be disposable but super cool!
