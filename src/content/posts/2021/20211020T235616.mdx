I don't understand why we're still having this debate. There's broad consensus that asymptomatic PCR positives &gt;10 days don't require isolation. So why on earth would anyone argue that it's bad for an antigen test to be negative in that same scenario? <a href="https://x.com/i_petersen/status/1450940422407266305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/i_petersen/status/1450940422407266305</a>
