Just listened to an excellent account of the history of hand washing in obstetrics by @tpwky: <a href="https://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/2021/05/18/episode-73-puerperal-fever-seriously-wash-your-hands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/2021/05/18/episode-73-puerperal-fever-seriously-wash-your-hands/</a>.   
  
Why did it take decades after compelling evidence existed for doctors to accept that washing their hands would save lives? Is this problem entirely solved now?
