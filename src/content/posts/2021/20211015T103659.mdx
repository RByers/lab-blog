The BEST way to prevent COVID-19 is hand washing? Thanks for the tip, but instead I will teach my kids to look for health advice which cites its sources rather than blindly trusting people comfortable in their position of authority. For example: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/14/qa-does-handwashing-stem-the-transmission-of-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/14/qa-does-handwashing-stem-the-transmission-of-covid-19</a> <a href="https://x.com/PublicHealthON/status/1449005903710244868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/PublicHealthON/status/1449005903710244868</a>

Actually @PublicHealthON, just checking your own sources from 5 months ago would have helped you avoid this incorrect tweet. This document lists hand hygiene last after 6 other mitigations like masking, avoiding crowded spaces, and improved ventilation: <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/2021/05/wwksf-transmission-respiratory-aerosols.pdf?la=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/2021/05/wwksf-transmission-respiratory-aerosols.pdf?la=en</a>
