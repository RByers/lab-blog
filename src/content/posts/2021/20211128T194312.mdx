I was pleasantly surprised to discover that a third of all know  cases are now being sequenced in Ontario. A huge improvement not often discussed! <a href="https://x.com/EdTubb/status/1465086438412795911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/EdTubb/status/1465086438412795911</a>

Unfortunately the data lags by a few weeks, so it'll be at least a couple weeks before we have a clear idea of how much omicron we have. And we're still under-testing, so maybe our sequencing coverage is somewhere around 10% of ALL cases.
