Some great data here. But this fails to ask the key question: is "pausing reopening" alone likely to be sufficient to prevent ICU overload? If not, what more should we be doing? <a href="https://x.com/COVIDSciOntario/status/1459192741355786245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/COVIDSciOntario/status/1459192741355786245</a>

With waning immunity (protection from infection only 6x, not 7x anymore), more time being spent indoors and lowering humidity, I fear we'll have to do a lot more than "pause" to keep from having a disaster on our hands.
