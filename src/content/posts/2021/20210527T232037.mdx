Great to see a wastewater COVID surveillance dashboard online for Waterloo region: <a href="https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-wastewater-surveillance.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-wastewater-surveillance.aspx</a>

As infections move more to the younger unvaccinated population who are also less likely to be symptomatic, this helps indicate how much we're missing with testing.

Hopefully regular wastewater surveillance of respiratory pathogens becomes common practice in the future. We have complicated surveillance to help us answer "should I wear a raincoat today", why not also "should I wear a mask"?
