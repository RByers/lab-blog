@UWaterloo is making free at-home rapid COVID tests available to all students and staff: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/testing-rapid-screening-and-vaccinations#screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/testing-rapid-screening-and-vaccinations#screening</a>. Great leadership! This should be extended to every school at every level across Canada.

I'm working with a few Canadian public school parent groups and private school administrators to get them free rapid COVID tests for kids to voluntarily use at home before school. If you'd like to participate, please fill in this form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyH32XeG2CZJN89pRr7sUr0vzDzrv-8weeYzLqTt17EdpOjA/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyH32XeG2CZJN89pRr7sUr0vzDzrv-8weeYzLqTt17EdpOjA/viewform</a>

For those asking - these are the same Panbio test kits being used in the various Canadian government workplace testing programs. Eg. see Ontario instructions here: <a href="https://www.ontariohealth.ca/COVID-19/Health-System-Response-Resources#testing-and-assessment-centres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ontariohealth.ca/COVID-19/Health-System-Response-Resources#testing-and-assessment-centres</a> and in particular this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP3aqwO5rJo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP3aqwO5rJo</a>

Correction: despite unclear wording on the page, I have it on good authority that the tests are only provided to people who are unvaccinated. That's a shame - vaccinated people can still get infected and transmit (but at perhaps 1/8th the rate in Ontario right now).
