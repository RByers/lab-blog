Throat+nasal swabbing significantly more sensitive than nasal alone in both Panbio and BTNX.  
I was worried that the NP swab that comes with the BTNX kits wouldn't work well in the throat, but it seems not to be an issue! <a href="https://x.com/DavidJuncker/status/1485024750741213185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/DavidJuncker/status/1485024750741213185</a>
