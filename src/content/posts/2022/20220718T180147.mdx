Despite our best safety efforts, my son and I got COVID while travelling in the US. We both qualified for Paxlovid and it worked extremely well except that I had a rebound. Here's a visual representation of the progression with RAT images. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FcPSet0gHpoW9WQ4GTBCdV7brnDfEOC5fRTTvx4-mBQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FcPSet0gHpoW9WQ4GTBCdV7brnDfEOC5fRTTvx4-mBQ/edit?usp=sharing</a>

I researched Paxlovid in some detail in advance and saw the trials showed a &lt;2% risk of rebound, same as placebo. But I regret not searching Twitter, as if I had seen this I would have delayed starting my treatment a couple days post symptom onset. <a href="https://x.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1521249046425440258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1521249046425440258</a>

I'm sad that when COVID finally caught up with me, I was away from my lab and so couldn't collect daily samples for PCR Ct monitoring. I did collect one sample near the end, I'm hoping to figure out how to get it sequenced so I can see where we fell on <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global/6m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global/6m</a>.
