My first run on a minION sequencer. If all goes to plan, later today I'll have the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that infected me!

24 million bases called in less than 30 min, should be more than enough for a 30kb genome!

It looks like I had BA.5.2.1.
Here's a screenshot of some reads showing a A-&gt;G mutation at 27038, one of the defining mutations of the BA.5.2.1 lineage: <a href="https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/657</a>

Correction: using a more recent Nextstrain it more precisely classified my virus as BF.28, aka. BA.5.2.1.28.
