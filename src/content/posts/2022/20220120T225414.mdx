Great to see some hard data on this! Based on many anecdotes I'm surprised there's not more gain w/ Omicron, but I'll take preprint data over random anecdotes any day! <a href="https://x.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1484316590715723776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1484316590715723776</a>

Given their great track record on rapid testing, I trust NS public health!
