I attended a week-long conference with ~400 people. Every single one of us did a rapid test every morning and wore a mask when indoors (almost all N95). Many of us ate only outdoors. It really wasn't hard at all and worth it to see people IRL! <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/09/TPAC/health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/2022/09/TPAC/health.html</a>

I, and many others, would have still attended with fewer rules. I'm sure many felt it was overkill for them personally. But we all knew someone at higher risk and so we were happy to take extra precautions to be as inclusive as possible.

Also the organizers did an awesome job ensuring people could participate in every meeting remotely. Being in person was better, but being engaged was possible regardless of willingness to travel.
