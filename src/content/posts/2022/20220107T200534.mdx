Earlier this week I emailed a rapid testing expert to ask if they had data on throat vs. nasal swabbing. They told me no but they had symptoms themselves for the past two days but had tested negative in the nose. They did a throat swab and it was positive! Another nasal was neg.

I know it's too small of a sample, but that makes two of two people I've asked getting throat positive at least a day ahead of nasal. Its highly unlikely this is coincidence.
