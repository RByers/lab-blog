In the future, when we have outbreaks vaccines will be mailed to every house (eg. in nasal form). When new variants arise, we will test and update our vaccine formulations within weeks. Wastewater testing will mean the right vaccines will be sent to the right places quickly.

Most people will take these vaccines and rarely feel the need to alter their behavior otherwise. We'll look back on our failure to handle pandemics like COVID-19 like we now look back on sailors who struggled with scurvy due to lacking simple vitamin C supplements.

This may sound like sci-fi, but it's not really. We probably have the capacity to build up the technology today. So much physical and economic suffering due mainly to a lack of vision and willpower. 😢
