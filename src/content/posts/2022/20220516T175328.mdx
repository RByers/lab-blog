My daughter got some new pets today: genetically engineered Tetra GloFish®️

What excites me is not that these exist (standard lab work these days), but that PetSmart has a whole wall of them and people are by-and-large cool with it! 🤓

I'm picturing what PetSmart might look like in 20 years. Are we at the dawn of a modern "Cambrian Explosion" in biodiversity? Yes, gotta be mindful of ethics and safety.
