My wife was asked at the grocery store checkout if she'd like some free rapid tests and the clerk was clearly disappointed when she said "no thanks". 🙂  
My wife explained that we have purchased lots and want to make sure there's enough tax-funded tests for those less privileged.

According to the clerk, most people are glad to take them and the store has plenty of supply available. Can it be that we've nearly reached the elusive goal of universal access to rapid tests in Ontario? 🎉 @C19TestFinders
