Got some free samples today, each just a little tube of 0.05mL of liquid. First showed up packed in 2kg of dry ice, which seemed like overkill. Then the second arrived in 10kg! 🙄  
No wonder it's $3,600/mL! 😂  
  
At least my daughter and I got to have fun playing with dry ice! 😁

Also PSA: If you're going to drive with 12kg of dry ice in your car, please remember to open the windows and turn recirculate off!
