Is your intuition for which indoor spaced are safest from respiratory disease any better than mine?
1. Busy cruise ship nightclub
2. Packed cruise ship dining hall
3. Minibus with only 5 of 15 seats used
4. Large pharmacy with less than a dozen people in it

Because I've tested vehicle AC systems before, I figured the minibus would still be bad, even if mostly empty. But 2500ppm is still surprisingly bad!

BTW slow ramp down must be because sensor was buried in my bag.

But the pharmacy looked big, airy and mostly empty to me so I didn't initially think to wear a mask. But whoa 3000ppm, I guess that's efficient recirculating AC for you!

Given how packed it was, I expected the dining hall to be terrible, but it was only just poor around 1000ppm. 

Our room has also generally been around 800ppm so these ships have done something right with their HVAC!

The nightclub was the biggest surprise. It felt packed with people, yet was consistently below 1000ppm so I felt OK having a drink without a mask on.

Each of us has to choose how to balance physical health with mental health, but being informed by data can help!
