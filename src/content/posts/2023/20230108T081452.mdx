Can you guess what I was doing last night from this CO2 log?

There was a very sick kid in the seat behind my son, coughing and wiping her nose the whole flight. A flight attendant offered the Mom a mask for the child, but they didn't wear it. I guess we'll know in a few days if our N95s were good enough to protect us.

The times driving to and from the airports are also interesting. First driving in Florida with the AC on recirculate, then in Ontario with the heater on 🙂.

The dips in Florida correspond to when we got out of the car to do something, leaving the CO2 monitor in the car.
