My son had a bad cold a few weeks ago where the symptoms lasted for over two weeks!   
  
qPCR tests of 4 swabs confirm he wasn't shedding by day 15, and viral load dropped by a factor of 200 from day 4 to day 6.

This weekend's project: sequence this Rhinovirus to find out what type it was.  
  
It's the 4th Rhinovirus I've isolated from him in 2 years. Should I give him a scratch card to track collecting all 165 to complete his immune system training? 😂

Took me a few more weeks to get around to it, but I now have the 5' UTR of this virus sequenced: Rhinovirus A-77.
