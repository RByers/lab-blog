What nasal sprays do you use for reducing cold / COVID transmission? My family has used Vicks Early Defense (physical gel) in high-risk settings for over a year. I'm convinced it's reduced colds substantially. But there's more evidence for antihistamine and antiviral sprays.

In particular this new study for Azelastine is very compelling. A 67% reduction in placebo-controlled trials! But only available with a prescription in Canada. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12406145/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12406145/</a>

But also there are several good studies for Iota-Carrageenan gel antiviral spray showing a similar effect. This is available OTC in Canada as "Salinex ProTect" so I've just bought some to try. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493111/</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Salinex-ProTect-Clinically-Protection-Preservative/dp/B07KJY1RLR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.amazon.ca/Salinex-ProTect-Clinically-Protection-Preservative/dp/B07KJY1RLR</a>
