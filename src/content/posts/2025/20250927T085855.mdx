"the fever-associated ASD risk was attenuated among mothers who reported taking antipyretic medications (OR = 1.30, 95 % CI 0.59, 2.84), but remained elevated for those who did not (OR = 2.55, 95 % CI 1.30, 4.99)." 🤔 <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22562209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22562209</a>

Translation: fever in pregnancy is associated with autism, and so of course taking fever medicine is as well.  But taking Tylenol for fever appears strongly associated with much lower risk, not higher. Other fever medicines are already contraindicated during pregnancy.
