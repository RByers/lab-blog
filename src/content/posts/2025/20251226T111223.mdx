We took a bit of a gamble this Christmas thanks to home PCR. My teenagers got the flu. Normally we wouldn't have family over or let them leave their rooms without a mask. But by the 24th PCR showed low viral load (CT&gt;32) and rapid tests were negative, so we chose not to cancel.

While they were definitely still PCR-positive and symptomatic, I believe the data showed they were unlikely to be contagious. We ensured good airflow and warned people, but nonetheless had 11 guests over three days (including my parents spending the night).

In good scientific fashion I am registering my experiment here prior to having results. If any of us get the Flu in the next few days I'll sequence it to compare to the virus my kids had.
