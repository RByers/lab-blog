Prediction: home viral diagnostics will go from being largely unthinkable to commonplace over the next ~5 years. We will wonder how we lived without it, and why we didn't do it sooner when we had the technology for ages. <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1340379108069523460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1340379108069523460</a>

In 2002 I did an 8 week road trip around all of north America with a box of map books and quarters for payphones. GPS receivers and cell phones existed, but they were clumsy and expensive. By 2010 I wouldn't go out to a local restaurant without the GPS and maps in my iPhone. 😀

About 4 years ago I pitched an idea for a Google 20% project to do regular and convenient home viral surveillance. The feedback I got was "people won't change their behavior as a result of knowing what cold viruses they are carrying". 😂
