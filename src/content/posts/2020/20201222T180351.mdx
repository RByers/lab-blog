Imagine if birth control was available only by proving to the government you were at high risk for pregnancy, and then only with reliable reporting of use to public health tied to your identity?

I can't stop thinking about @michaelmina_lab's empowerment arguments in <a href="https://youtu.be/L-RuvUkcyJI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://youtu.be/L-RuvUkcyJI</a>. I, for one, believe in empowering citizens to take calculated risks with their health and trusting everyone to be responsible.
