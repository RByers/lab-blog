The evidence is mounting that much of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is asymptotic or presymptomatic: <a href="https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing</a>

This has significant implications: we must be regularly screening all healthcare workers and other essential workers if we want to control the spread. Eg: <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30917-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30917-X/fulltext</a>

Which in turn suggests that to be practical, we should leverage pooled-sample qPCR, eg: <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20039438v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20039438v1</a>
